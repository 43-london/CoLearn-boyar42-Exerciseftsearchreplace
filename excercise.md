##Exercise: ft_search_replace
Allowed functions: malloc

• Create a function that replaces every occurrence of a string within another string.
• The function returns the modified string where each occurrence of the 'search' string has been replaced by the 'replace' string.
• The modified string given as a result should be a newly allocated string.
• The original string should not be modified.
• Here's how it should be prototyped:
`char *ft_search_replace(char *orig, char *search, char *replace);`
